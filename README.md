## Wireframes:
[The wireframes for this project are available on GitHub](https://github.com/AlexAriasL/milestone1_ramones/blob/master/ramones_wireframes.pdf)


## Technologies Used:

1. HTML5
2. CSS3
3. Bootstrap v4.3.1
3. GIT
4. Jquery
5. Google Fonts
6. Fontawsome


## UX & Design
The main concern was for the site to be an accurate reflection of the DIY/unpolished style that characterized the Ramones.
Becuae of this, we opted for a stripped down look and fonts that emulate handwiting.
The idea was to replicate handwritten notes on a notebook or scrap of paper. Furthermore,
we wanted the site to be simple, clear an direct. In terms of colours, we opted for a pallete made up of black,
a few shades and tints of purple (navbar and different heders) and yellow (to emphasize the socia media links).

## Website Structure & Features:

This is a single page website divided in a navbar, six sections and a footer.

### The Navbar:
The navbar has a toggler menu built in for ease of access on mobile devices. To further enhance the user experience,
a Scrollspy feature was added.


### Landing Page:
This is the first piece of content a user will see when accesing the site.
It is made up o a large image of the band playing on stage. It should appeal to existing fans and
other users interested in learning more about the band.

### Music Section:
This showcases some of the best know songs by the band. Of course, its content can be updated
to promote new releases. It also can be used as a gateway to other areas of online presence such as
Spotify, Soundcloud and so on.

### Video Section:
This includes a sample of the best known videoclips and live performances by the band. Should the band have one,
this section could be a defacto gateway to their official YouTube channel.

### Bio Section:
This includes basic biographical facts for all the band members.

### Tour Dates Section:
This provides information about upcoming gigs. It gives the option to purchase tickets for them.

### Book The Band Section:
it provides a communication channel with music promoters and/or festivl organizers
that may want to hire the band.
